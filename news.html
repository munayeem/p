            <h1>OnePlus shows off its sub-$500 smartphone, the OnePlus Nord</h1>
            <p>OnePlus has shown off the design of its upcoming midrange smartphone,
                the OnePlus Nord. YouTuber Marques Brownlee interviewed OnePlus'
                Global Director Carl Pei and showed off a few glimpses of the upcoming device.
            </p>
            <p>Like the rumors indicated, the front of the device features two selfie
                cameras in an oval-shaped cutout. The phone's appearance is reminiscent
                of a Samsung Galaxy S10+ but with the hole punch on the opposite side
                of the display. The back camera block follows the same design language
                as earlier OnePlus phones by putting everything in a vertical strip,
                but on the Nord, the camera assembly is in the corner of the phone
                instead of centered in the middle like previous devices.
            </p>
            <p>The phone is shaping up to be a pretty great-looking offering, but it
                won't launch in the United States at first. The official explanation
                is from OnePlus CEO Pete Lau is that "we are going to start relatively
                small with this new product line by first introducing it in Europe and
                India. But don't worry, we're also looking to bring more affordable
                smartphones to North America in the near future as well."
